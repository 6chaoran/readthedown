- The CSS for the `html_docco` format is heavily inspired from the default one of the [docco](https://ashkenas.com/docco/) project.
- The CSS and JavaScript for `readthedown` is adapted from the corresponding `readtheorg` theme of the [org-html-themes](https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes) project, which is itself inspired by the [Read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/) [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) theme.
- The CSS and JavaScript for `material` has been taken from the [Material design theme for Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design) project and its [presentation page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/).
- The CSS for `robobook` is directly derived from the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) project template.
- The CSS for `downcute` is directly derived from the default theme of the [docute](https://github.com/egoist/docute) project and its adaptation by [John Coene](https://twitter.com/jdatap) for some of its [projects documentation](https://packer.john-coene.com/).
- The `downcute chaos` theme has been created by [Zac Garland](https://github.com/zac-garland).
- JavaScript and HTML code for code folding and tabbed sections are taken from the RStudio's default `rmarkdown` HTML template.
