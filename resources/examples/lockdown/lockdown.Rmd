# What's this ?

`lockdown` is a not-so-fond tribute to the not-so-lovely 2020 year and the Covid-19 pandemic.

The main and only feature of this template is to add a warning on external links, so that each time you want to get out, you'll get a friendly reminder of the things to take care about to stay safe.

You can test it by, for example, <a href="https://www.r-project.org">clicking this wonderful link</a>.

Take care !
